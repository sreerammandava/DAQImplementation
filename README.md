# Following is code, shell configuration, and slides situated for DAQ implementation on MA40S0S Transducers at 40 kHz.
1. Demonstrates conditional relationship of TX/RX w/ varying distances of separation.
2. Identify usage at varying frequencies, utilizing the DAQ sampling rate with varying TX frequencies.
3. Comparative performance to that of the Oscilloscope.
